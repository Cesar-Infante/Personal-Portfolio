# Personal-Portfolio

Building a portfolio is a necessity when showcasing completed projects/work! Going through this challenge was definitely challenging, from designing a whole layout on how my portfolio should look to bringing it to life by coding it out. The critical requirements we had to include were making sure my name, photo, and links to my work were visible along with ways to contact me (Hello everyone viewing!). Feel free to click on my projects link and contact me link they will both bring you to the corresponding section. This portfolio is also adjusted for various screen sizes and devices! Very important as most applications are viewed on a mobile device before on a desktop.
