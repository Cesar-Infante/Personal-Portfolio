            <p id="bio"> Hello everyone! üëã I am 23 years old, a major tech enthusiast from a young age; I would
                take things apart to see how they would function, eventually leading me to build computers
                for fun! During the past few years I was working as a warehouse lead and got the news the
                company was relocating but this pivotal moment is what lead me to take a leap of faith into
                the tech industry and become a software developer. üë®‚Äçüíª
